## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you've discovered a security issue in my software, I'd appreciate it if you could let me know as soon as possible. I'll investigate all legitimate reports and act swiftly to fix any problems.

### Steps for Reporting

1. Open a **public issue** on this repository to responsibly disclose the suspected vulnerability.
3. If possible, provide steps that can help me reproduce the issue.
4. Please be patient as I work on a coordinated release of fixes.
5. I'll assess the risk and get back to you with my plans to address it.

Your help in responsibly disclosing your findings is invaluable and I will do my best to acknowledge your contributions.

## Disclosure Policy

When I learn of a security issue, my first priority is user safety. I'll work diligently to address the issue and then disclose it in a way that allows users to protect themselves.

Thanks for helping to keep this project and our community safe!
