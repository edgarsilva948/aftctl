`aftctl` is a CLI designed to simplify the deployment process of Amazon Account Factory for Terraform (AFT). It follows best practices for Terraform state file isolation, making it easier for you to manage state files securely and efficiently. Additionally, `aftctl` facilitates seamless upgrades and modifications to your AFT configurations in the future.
